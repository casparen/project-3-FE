# Project 3: GiphyBirthday
### Team Members: Alberto Gomez, Harry Hur, Caspar Nagel, Mimi Wu

## Elevator Pitch
GiphyBirthday let’s you surprise your favorite people with your favorite gifs from across the web. Sign up to get in on the fun!


## Background
The idea of creating this GiphyBirthday app came about when we all agreed that we have a tendency to forget people's birthdays, especially those that hold near and dear to us. We wanted to create an app that will remind us of someone's birthday, so it allows us to take action and show them that we <i>remembered</i>. What kind of actions? When you are notified you have a chance to remember to plan a suprise birthday? Make a call? Write a note? Send an email? With the GiphyBirthday, not only do we send you a text reminder of someone's birthday, but we give you a chance to log onto our site and send a giphy and text message! What a fun way to make someone feel special!


## Technical Details
The GiphyApp is a tool for the masses to better communicate throughout the year. It leverages twilio.com, giphy.com apis and we’ve developed a roadmap that will incorporate other complimentary apis (Refer to the image in the planning phase folder).

Users are required to sign in to join the community. We’ve designed a way for users to programmatically connect with their friends, families and followers.

How it works: the user signs in once and is notified when anyone from their group’s birthday approaches via text message.  

Technologies used: Twilio API, Giphy API, Firebase Database and Authentication, Bootstrap React, React, Node

## MVP
1. Use Twilio API to send text and giphy to birthday person's cell  
2. Use Giphy API to filter on birthday related giphys that would be used with Twilio to send message to birthday person's cell  
3. Use Firebase for authentication
4. Create profile page for new users and allow them to edit information
5. Use firebase to store new user information and edited user information
6. Use React Router for navigation

## Responsibilities and Contributions
As a team we spent a day brainstorming the perfect app that would solve a common problem. We came up with so many ideas that ultimately we came up with a birthday reminder, since we tend to forget people's birthdays, especially with our busy schedules. After some wireframing sessions and mild panic attacks during feasibility testing to figure out whether or not we can make this app work, we deliver you our MVP.

We went through planning, regression testing, unit testing, UI testing, lots of development, and debugging. Caspar and Harry took the lead on making sure we were in the right direction in terms of logic of the app, which was crucial in getting the firebase authentication and database to work. Al and Mimi worked on the wireframing, researched, tested several API and was also involved in the development and design of the app in React.
